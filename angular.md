### Building Blocks

1. Modules - libraries
2. Directices - extensions to the DOM (via jQuery or jQlite); also a listener, watching for changes
3. Controllers - bingings between JavaScript scope and the DOM
4. Services - external data (only one instance - singleton pattern)


yeoman.io - abstraction layer
